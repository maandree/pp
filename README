NAME
	pp - page pager

SYNOPSIS
	pp [OPTION]... [--] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
	Displays a plain-text file page-by-page. It assumes
	that the file includes page breaks. If the file does
	not include page breaks the entire file will be printed
	to the terminal and the program will exit. If the
	file only includes one page, the the entire page will
	be printed to the terminal and the program will exit.

	Escape sequences are printed as-is. This means for
	example that colour can be used in the file, but if
	the colours span over page breaks, you would best
	pass it through a preprocessor first that files this.
	Or better yet; fix the file.

	If no file is specified, or if '-' i specified, stdin
	will be paged.

		be omitted if it is empty.

RATIONALE

	that does not have any images.
