.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pp
.RI [ OPTION ]...\ [\-\-]
.RI [ FILE ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Displays a plain-text file page-by-page. It assumes
that the file includes page breaks. If the file does
not include page breaks the entire file will be printed
to the terminal and the program will exit. If the
file only includes one page, the the entire page will
be printed to the terminal and the program will exit.
.PP
Escape sequences are printed as-is. This means for
example that colour can be used in the file, but if
the colours span over page breaks, you would best
pass it through a preprocessor first that files this.
Or better yet; fix the file.
.PP
If no file is specified, or if \- i specified,
stdin will be paged.
